# Brand Guidelines

**Devfolio Brand Assets**

Rules are boring but rules are important. We have listed down a few things you need to keep an eye on while showcasing our brand and we would really appreciate it if you could go through all of them. These include guidelines for our logos, names, content, and trademarks and a few do’s and don’t while using them.

**Things you might need:**

1. `Logo + Text` assets involve the Devfolio 'D' logo with the 'Devfolio' text without any background.

It has three variants -

- `White` <img src ="Logo + Text - White/Devfolio - White.png" style="width: 100px; background-color: #2F3437; padding: 8px 10px 8px 10px; border-radius: 8px;margin-left: 20px; ">
- `Dark` <img src ="Logo + Text - Dark/Devfolio - Dark.svg" style="width: 100px; margin-left: 20px;">
- `Coloured` <img src ="Logo + Text - Colored/Devfolio - Normal.svg" style="width: 100px; margin-left: 20px; border: 1px solid grey; padding: 8px 10px 8px 10px">

2. `Logo` has the classic coloured 'D' logo in all its glory. <img src ="Logo/Logo.svg" style="width: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">

3. `Devfolio Square` involves a white 'D' logo with the signature blue background. <img src ="Devfolio Square/Square.png" style="width: 30px; margin-left: 20px;">

4. Devfolio and its assets make use of the following colours:

- **White:** _rgba(255,255,255)_
- **Grey:** _rgba(39, 51, 57, 1)_
- **Blue:** _rgba(55, 112, 255, 1)_

Note: If you're using Devfolio's D as a profile picture and the D doesn't seem to be centered, try using `Devfolio Square/Logo-Square centred.png`

**Do's**

1. You are free to use the above brand assets in good faith to represent the products and services that we offer.

2. Any uses in hackathons, or any other events organized need to be affiliated with and registered on the Devfolio platform.
